  DONE:

- Pages 1, 2, 3 for survey project done

- the modal Dialog now outside the component
  thus, for each usage of the component 
  a separate dialog can be defined
  and implemented in the parent.

  now i made it with reference to the child

- testing function new row: 
  set state filter, remove state filter

  parameters to pass values
