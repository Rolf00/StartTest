  16.12.2024 - 20.12.2024
  ----------------------
  DONE
- button dialog like confirm

- modal dialog for editing

- save one row / save all rows with checks of values and error message

- save data before special button click
  after editing, the user should not leave whithout saving

- date from...to: solution made
  now a check is implemented
  dates from...to with correct checks are now possible, see example

- sorting done with many columns
  fixed bug sorting of dates in your code: not parseINT, but Date.parse
  now it works. please check it.

- resizing the column width is much faster now

- hiding and managing columns
  hide one column
  header menu: unhide in a submenu

- header menu : filtering with multiple columns
  at the moment: just one operator per column 
  header menu filtering states edited, deleted, inserted
  but maybe a dialog is needed. prepared, bot only working in sandbox
